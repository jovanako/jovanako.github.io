      <h1>A few words about me</h1>

        <p class="about-me-text">
         I have always been a <em>language-lover</em>. I have studied several languages 
         throughout my life, French, English, Italian, German, and I have always found 
         joy in wordplay, origin of words, different meanings of words and finding out 
         <em>how languages develop</em>. I come from Serbia and what I've always found 
         fascinating is how our language developed throughout history with strong 
         influences from the Turkish, German and lots of other languages. I always 
         enjoy when I discover an origin of another Serbian word, especially when it 
         originates from another language that I can understand.

        <p class="about-me-text">I have always had a knack for learning languages and 
         it is relatively easy for me to learn a new language. Actually, it was, 
         before I started learning German :). Having graduated with a master's degree 
         in English Language and Literature and finding the jobs in that field in my 
         country scarce and unsatisfactory, I came to the idea to 
         <strong>learn a computer language</strong>. Not that it can be compared to learning 
         a human language, but for me it has been equally fun and challenging. And the 
         <strong>MAGIC</strong> that happens when I run my code and it does what I 
         want it to do, that is what makes all of the hard work worth it. Kind of 
         like the hard work I put into learning the little German that I know pays 
         off when I can understand what my younger son is talking about :).</p><br><br>

        <p class="about-me-text">When I'm not learning, I like to listen to music, dance, 
          meet up with friends, read a good book, go skateboarding, rollerblading, or go on 
          bicycle rides with my family, play with my kids or watch TV shows with my husband. 
          I really love photography and take photos whenever I can. I also love to sing, 
          even though it's not really my strong side, which my family members can confirm.
