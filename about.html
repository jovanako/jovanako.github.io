      <div id="about-me">
        <h2>Hi, I'm Jovana</h2>
        <p>I have always been a <em>language-lover</em>. I have studied several languages 
          throughout my life, French, English, Italian, German, and I have always found 
          joy in wordplay, origin of words, different meanings of words and finding out 
          <em>how languages develop</em>. I come from Serbia and what I've always found 
          fascinating is how our language developed throughout history with strong 
          influences from the Turkish, German and lots of other languages. I always 
          enjoy when I discover an origin of another Serbian word, especially when it 
          originates from another language that I can understand.<br><br>
          I have always had a knack for learning languages and it was always relatively 
          easy for me to learn a new language. That is, before I started learning 
          German :).<br><br>
          Having graduated with a master's degree in English Language and Literature and
          being unable to find a job in that field, at some point I came to the idea to 
          <strong>learn a computer language</strong>. Not that it can be compared to 
          learning a human language, but for me it has been equally fun and challenging. 
          And the <strong>MAGIC</strong> that happens when I run my code and it does what I 
          want it to do, that is what makes all of the hard work worth it. Kind of like the 
          hard work I put into learning the little German that I know is worth it when I can 
          understand what my younger son is talking about :). <br><br>
          When I'm not learning, I like to listen to music, dance, meet up with friends,
          read a good book, go skateboarding, rollerblading, or bicycle rides with my 
          family, play with my kids or watch TV shows with my husband. I really love 
          photography and take photos whenever I can. I also love to sing, even though 
          it's not really my strong side, which my family members can confirm.
